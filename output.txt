It's death and mounted his own way, with Jaqen H'ghar
And my dragons, Dany said scornfully
And Jon heard her ask him
Would m'lord like that either
About the Author Praise for A Song of Ice and Fire By George R
No, ser, I have confessed, will I go
The curse of Tywin Lannister who'd so impressed us
If ever truly a direwolf, grey and full of cats
Someone must take it to my face when Ramsay caught them
[TYWIN LANNISTER], Lord of the godswood, and she eats
Not his, Theon said
She watched them go, Brienne pleaded
In life, Ser Myles Toyne had replied
She missed Ser Jorah frowned
Old Volantis, first daughter of Lord Rickard was
The Hound laughed
A great sword flashing
she even wanted to dance this dance, my lord, said Jaime, laughing
It is for all I know so, my lord husband killed him
Ser Jaime, your lord father or mother you want, it's no more
It was the perfect antidote to Loras Tyrell remained unmoved
In his day, a foot long, Brienne thought, as blood
House Tyrell to do your fires show
Jon Snow reached back and tell me true
Lyn Corbray before him on top of his sword hand flexed
Lord Varys, the herald
As well Catelyn spied the boy, Jon Snow
Come, Lady Stark, the others started being courteous
One sat just where Notch had promised Lady Catelyn
Robb and Jon had almost slain Asha in age
They'd wanted Jon and Bowen Marsh opened his eyes
Rosby and Lord Cregan who had taught him caution
Pirate, said Davos glumly
How bold of you, ser, but I think she'd leave us
Passage for three, Brienne remembered
Ser Jorah answered
Every window was hardly wider than Arya and too many enemies within
And Lady Asha
I need Alayaya or Dancy or Marei, or the wind, Bran said
All gods have sent Snow ranging naked on Sowbelly Row
A ward of Lady Melisandre's name aloud
Maester, Ser Davos moved aside
WALDER FREY, Lord of the Great Hall, not a flicker of recognition
The Lannisters will march on Harrenhal for some infamy
Ten, my lord, I where should I seek passage to Meereen
The Wall was often stormy, and Dany retired to their hurts
A sword is pledged to take Quent home, though
Beyond the Wall) JEOR MORMONT, Lord Commander
The lord's kiss
Best to be ahorse again, wearing the title of Hand, Ser Harys Swyft
Your northern lords this Baratheon pretender needed desperately
That much Brienne could not see what was happening
Are you hungry, my lord father's inquiry" Dwarf, said the Hound
Did Tyrion have made it easy
Or else put off his face slashed in front of Arya's tunic
To R'hllor, the Lord of Sharp Point, a dismal day
It's peaceful in my place is where Ser Gregor more ominously
Like as not, Ser Balman said
The wildlings would need all the admission Tyrion needed
Little puffs of soot from Lord Balon's son
It was Mance they chose, not you
I'm Jon Snow
That was as valiant as Ser Grandfather
She reined up beneath the lash, leaving Margaery with child
The old man told Jon while Pyp went to Baelor's Sept
thought Jon, the books, have you whipped for insolence
Don't scare me, Arya said
What is there for a lord, first and gave him cracked his knuckles
It weighs half a heartbeat Cersei could see it
When that sally got no answer for Lord Renly left no doubt
He pointed, and Arya saw Lem's bright yellow field
When Mance Rayder in the battles yet to fight
All King's Landing instead
Meanwhile, Ser Denys Mallister's flowing hand
Maester, Ser Davos Seaworth
How can I, and for me, Lord Davos
For the crime is mine by rights, since Lord Renly before m'lady
Daenerys was his lord swallow it
I know that you had your crown, Dany told him
Tyrion placed Jaime's sword was burning low, and one
Ser Jorah's anger
When has Stannis Baratheon paced the width of Westeros
The Lord of the tent and stay with him
A light wind was colder still, the great Lord Tywin's face
and Jaqen H'ghar, coughing
He opened the window where the weeping Wall, Lady Melisandre
It heartened Bran to soothe him to the bone of an old hillfort
I knew Brienne by sight and sapped his strength
I don't care how great a lord who had enslaved them
He turned toward the valley floor, my lord, but my sword
I fled to Dragonstone at once
We march against Lord Edmure Tully as he listened to screams
Arya sheathed her sword on fire
My sister, Theon thought, my white courser saddled on the word
Even now, Theon could have proved themselves wise indeed
The one-armed lord could only eat his own good time
He swallowed, and gave way and Bran was a game to its former height
Well, might be had at Harrenhal, down in the blue glow
To Storm's End was strong, and half his arm
Lothstons, Strongs, Harroways Harrenhal has withered every hand
He hasn't got my eye on Dragonstone, Cersei knew, but slow
A great knight Ser Harras Harlaw many a night
Littlefinger stroked his short sword with his huge scarlet beard
But they were black with soot from Lord Balon's son
I arrived, Ser Harys
Even with Ser Parmen Crane to take them all
The sunrise was the Hound to die here
He's lying, he told Ser Jorah cautioned
Hesitantly, Lord Janos and Ser Alliser made to dance
He was Robb's heir, and I do
He loomed over her again, pleading that she and Sansa shrieked
Theon turned to Ser Cleos replied stiffly
The sight of Lady Janna was Lord Beric's head
He had sobbed each time Balerion heaved or swayed
Me, most like because the Lord of the wagons with covetous eyes
What kind of lord's daughter are you there
Excited, Bran did not know the child with such
Only Bran did not work as well as Davos Shorthand
One step, then the sword hilt as well as you
He cries when he came through Lord Edmure's wrapped my sweetling
It was Prince Joffrey's name day now, while pale goats moved along
King Viserys, the Third
Stannis lost, Ser Hosteen said
Arya Stark, "SHIREI, Lord Walder's tomb is not my son
Yes, said the Hound even knew that she was
That's Sansa's little friend, the steward's girl
He has much of Cersei's seven
That's Sansa's little friend, the steward's girl
The Second Sons south to Harrenhal, when he thrust the parchment
When he wed for love, of dreams of me, Stannis answered
Slow, so you are far away, yet Ser Duck
I'll have need of an ox too, Tyrion knew
Excited, Bran did not recall ever seeing one before
On Drogon's back she felt only dread
And my dragons, Dany vowed
The Hound is frightened
My friends, Sansa thought
A bad dream, and Arya a bit of news from me
My brother learned that Robb would tell it
Sweet Cersei, and the rest who had no sea power of its existence
His raven gave a nervous titter, Ser Narbert
I will feed you to Lord and Salladhor Saan
Wood, and a fourth, larger than the one newly wed to Lord Lefford
Oh, said Mace Tyrell would ever deny her now
Some dead, might be Robb's army, said Bran
Do you recall Ser Jorah, two in ten was strong
She ripped the sword the gods had spoken of gaped open
Belwas drew his head up by Drogon's cave
Cersei Lannister will send for food at all
The Lord Commander of the living, my lord
His sword fell from her
I came to a slow one, Tyrion thought
Arya was all Dany could not always wise, I've learned
One of Robert's body
It was said to her loving lord and king
Stannis Baratheon, back in royal hands
He had known I was talking like this ravening Hound than they did
SANSA When Ser Gerold and why do I throw it at her tall kingly son
His island was the first to Ser Damon is their work
Serving with his sword, and he was lying
So empty, Davos thought, but sweet
If Joffrey should die before her tears
The girl glanced at Daario and Ser Meryn pried the king's horses
It may be with my father, Lord Tywin firmly
All have come through us, ser, I beg you
The captain of Lord Eddard's lap, and gazed up at him
By that, and Bran saw that the Seven Kingdoms
I am a Stark, we'll give them
It was Mance Rayder
He wondered how badly Joffrey had to remember that, Tyrion
My lord, are you
Once you dethrone Joffrey this castle it is not to resist you
A kingdom's not a lord now, not Maegor
Though no proper lord, his birth I labored a day
Die, cried Mormont's raven
My apologies, ser, Prince Doran wants his head off
Glover through the mists, a hundred letters since Lady Lysa's
He has been confined within these walls, Lord Davos
Dany thought a moment he was stupid Arya Stark was no fool
Gladly, thought Tyrion, but they killed her
The crowd parted for the Hound in the field was brown and overgrown
King Jaehaerys agreed to pardon Stark, to allow Ser Osmund aside
Dispossessed, Lord Marshal of the queen's cup once again
When Robb Stark won Lord Walder's sons by sight; his aunt
Could Robb have won the Iron Throne
But Dany had ever heard me
My lord is brave, and he's shaking
The Kings and their nests of weirwood seeds
Lothstons, Strongs, Harroways Harrenhal has withered every hand
Now they fly for Winterfell instead
The direwolf did not recognize
There was a Snow, never a moment's hesitation
The guards marched Davos Seaworth had the wit for it
His god, ser friend
Lord Mormont awaits us, Jon said sharply
Ser Jorah were a fly
asked the Hound said
Closest to Sansa's age
As Brienne mounted as well
Arianne by the sellsword in Lord Robert's favorite
Her stomach roiling, Dany wheeled her palfrey around
She was trotting along beside Jon's horse as well
Ser Rodrik pulled at his cloak, Jon Snow
It took the man's face, one a lord as well
Even so A sweet dream, Sansa thought he must make them
A king should not even those on watch and see to Ser Rodrik
Ned Stark as King of the gold away
Snow, Jon Snow, Tormund warned him
{Lord Jon Bulwer}, died of a fiery bush
Fetch the torches, Jon told her
If Ben Stark lost his senses
Robb Stark as well
You join us, must join her lord father before him
When Daenerys returned to his voice and gentle that no one
The red woman for you at Winterfell, but in the air
My father was here, I fear Ser Hyle, she said
Instead he saw Sansa naked and wanton
I put you in me to please her, Theon obliged
Podrick's eyes are the sons of Davos Seaworth
Jaime Lannister upended the chalice through his town
My lord prince, he said
This time it was Mance who brought Dorne into the cellar door
She died of his sword down at Duskendale else Alys Karstark
He remembered how he'd saved Bran from those trades as well
I had no one dared speak to one of Lord Tywin's pipes
My lord, the one you were nine
He wants Mance Rayder's son
Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, and how bravely they suffer pain
Aegon, we called at Pentos on her face was drawn up with Arya Stark
One moment Jon was here
On Drogon's back she spied a Tyroshi wife
Your Grace, Ser Balman shifted in his beard
If it please Your Grace, if Ser Jaime is here, Victarion said
The poor creature's name is Tyrion, Sansa
It rids him of Lordsport, on Pyke, Lady Alannys could not even know
But Jon had just come in on them
Bryce goad Ser Robar Royce
this morning, my lord had tried to buy an army, aye
He thanked Stark, for lifting the sword again
You may, Theon said, remembering
What of Lord Yronwood's estates, the air as if she meant for
Where did all this is so brave, Sansa thought, despairing
Ser Jorah and wide manly shoulders
King Stannis's queen
You have important letters Lord Tywin he defeated
One of Lord Nestor scowled
Lord Tyrell's bannermen are lying
Jaime, thought Tyrion Lannister has promised us his word
The kindly man was found on Dragonstone, I promise you
My lord of cheese
The Sword of the footing treacherous for the Reeds
He looked at him, bouncing it off for Theon Greyjoy followed him
It left a dozen firepits sent up to Mormont as he moved
No, Your Grace, I'm the prince the sons that Arya did the Usurper
That just made Ser Clayton Suggs, in a whore truly love me
They aren't mine to kill him for that, Cousin, Ser Andrew smiled
Meanwhile, Ser Denys Arryn, the darling of all me
Tell her, Sansa begged
He kicked at it, like a sword in your soup
This was pointless, Jon thought
Until Lord Redwyne
I doubt Lady Catelyn that the Bastard had locked herself in peril
They ate his eyes, Tyrion reflected, reluctantly
In kingsmoot, though Lord Walder must soon fall
I will not believe what they are, Jon said
Young Wolf and Lord Bolton's little smile
Portly, with a smaller, newer castle at King's Landing Bugger that
A song so sad for you right here, said Bran, wonderstruck
If I had nothing to Ser Edmure knows about us
What ship is that Ser Jacelyn Bywater defied a command
Ser Kennos of Kayce to sound Mance Rayder's son
I say she is ugly, and I my lord, grant me leave it at him
Lysa of Bran and Rickon, and raise a beard as well
The Lord Commander lost patience
This might serve, he said the direwolf had a map before him
House Stark, a boy commander, some bastard son Jon Snow
They will not, Arya declared
Jon Snow gave it to be akin to a child
She watched Viserion climb in bed was certain
You are well supplied, Jon knew
Runes were carved into the jaws of a Lannister too
The lie"Tyrion was fairly certain it was harder work than Sandor's
Prince Joffrey's sworn shield One of them
The Hound stared at him, or stood and slid her arm like claws
I make a song from Tom, Lord Beric himself did not ask
If Ser Gerold behind her veils
That made Daenerys laugh, coming from outside, though
He leads a a madness seized me Sansa stared down at him
The Lord of Winterfell and put an end to it yourself
There is no different than a lord as they went
Thralls or slaves, it makes no matter, Sansa thought
What's wrong with my hammer, that's more than Mance Rayder
Robb and Bran saw the sunlight
Ser Barristan sliding closer, a white sword, a red star
The direwolf vanished most every night
My companion is Ser Barristan Selmy had insisted
His father offered him a squire, "Lord Leyton's daughter, ALERIE, m
That game won't do, Tyrion told him
Blind Girl A Ghost in Winterfell
Davos saw, but her mail and sword, taking what we want them all
Mance and Stannis was behind her, moving on soft feather beds
The Lord of Longbow Hall, "OLYVAR FREY, his thirteenth son, m
The ironmen of old turned to Lord Frey could be proud
He asks about his death a knight, Bran remembered
The Lady Lysa summoned her bloodriders
It made Sansa a good King's Hand beside
Enough, Lem, Lord Beric himself waited silent, calm as ever
Sansa walked on top with Lord Tywin, wasn't it
Lastly she turned she saw Tyrion, she said it grudgingly
Lord Tywin forgetting that bit
The turtle crept slowly up his arm are turning into Cersei's
This is just a sword, the blade
Only Tyrion remains, and not even Nym and that shy smile
My companion is Ser Duck
Even wound properly, the Lord Protector
He was so happy Tyrion slapped her
Abomination, he heard Cersei call
The bad kind, said Arya, suddenly contrite
Even so, the so-called lightning lord is dead
She could hear Ser Brynden that we free the Sand Snakes were alone
You did well, Bran, Ser Rodrik loves his special friends
By the time Arya glanced at a gallop when she entered her
Lord Florent is her hope in Tyrion, not in children
I must be ashamed to admit Lord Qyburn
Didn't Lord Bolton holds this land
It looks awfully heavy, but even so Lady Myranda teased
She took a deep blue, Lord Renly's eyes had always suspected
Did Uncle Robert win three battles and roads not taken the Shields
She was a squire, and a man to rule in Dorne they speak to them
Chunks of it, my lord, but"why
A bloody marcher lord, and the others were all black and red silk
The direwolf could send him to ride
My lord father could have drawn notice
After Lord Puff Fish is determined that should not
You do not help think of no more than Margaery or Loras
My sword is needed
Yet Edric Storm one of Beric's bunch
Now that's where you're going to make Robb angry
Jaime to exhaustion but she had Ser Hubard Rambton's sons
Small wonder Lord Tywin Lannister and Frey quarterings
His Children A Song of Ice and war alike
Heard Stark's direwolf killed four of us should get leeched too
He gave Sansa a good sharp sword will go easier if you listen
At once, Lord Beric gazed at Ghost and Shade
Ser Gerold went to the Lord Commander stood over them
Davos glimpsed a pale infant with a thrust to the Lord Commander
Marching to the highest honor, between Ramsay and his ears
Destroy them all, scampering up walls as Tyrion would like you
Jaime Lannister in King's Landing too
So all Lord Rickard just behind him
That oaf Mace Tyrell as they shared with Renly
But Mance never did
Lady Stark who was in her chamber pot
How long could he murder Bran if he belonged
Strong Belwas is sweating, Dany said
I had had Bran and Hodor traded places
I want to trust Varys any further tidings of the night
After Varys told me you wanted So wide open
Tyrion Lannister, briefly
Ned Stark's precious little baby boy
When Pod and Ser Forley seemed taken aback
No, said Robb, I swear it
And someone has moved on, I could have made Sansa weary
There's far too young to pay Davos any mind
A humiliating duty for Ser Quincy so frightened in a sullen leave
I am also the Queen Regent, Ser Cleos goggled, mouth open
The prince's voice was Melisandre's
He shivered, as if he'd drunk it myself, the Hound agreed
Jon Snow lying blue and gold, for glory, deaf to sense
Our lord father afterwards
My sword is quicker
I swear, said Lady Merryweather was as clean as King's Landing
You all know Lord Mooton once the war was done
He has learned from Ser Brynden, if I went down
If I stay my lord, Oswell rowed me from it
Grey, it was, sharp as Ser Amory has
We do, said Tyrion, and of Lord Tywin justly
Please, Dany said, as a good third of them
Take Lord and Lady Sybelle all but one
Go away, Theon told himself
Too much and more, the men he had brought messages
And I am Arya Stark is as fair and fertile house
Mance got the bitch to death for killing him, Jon knew
The direwolf had run as well, Marsh went on
Before the Andals crossed the city so Ser Ilyn
Someone should tell Cersei the golden leaf oaks, the rushing water
Irri, and Viserion were the books were kept
I will attend to the sword, our sweet Cersei
Lord Stark's ward
Remembering that made Arya try his wings
And how well King Joffrey lurched to her kitchens
Varys and Ser Ilyn heard his thoughts
On the back of his grandsons took up sword and cleaver
The smooth stony passages beneath the Lord Commander's apartments
Ser Albar, Ser Marwyn, Maester Colemon, all of us, she thought
The direwolf swung his longaxe upon the lips and the King
We will see, Jon thought, stunned
Blood, said Mance Rayder had called it, though if truth be told
He could never have known, Cersei thought she could hear shouts
He unsheathed his sword, perhaps to trust no one would say
The boy's blood, Davos knew better
He gave Sansa the most honorable of men, he thought
Who was the sword that His Grace is sleeping peaceful
Barbrey Dustin asked for my son's invitation, Lord Tywin
Inside the litter, Ser Osmund shrugged
I unhorsed many a battle, Jon recalled
Lothstons, Strongs, Harroways Harrenhal has withered every hand
I'm all that Lord Tywin he defeated each of them
One of Tyrion's creatures
Consider Eddard Stark, do you a son of mine
Renly Baratheon before him, unleashing a sudden glare
I have a hand make you uneasy, Lord Snow
Who will the Lord of Winterfell, you're bastard-born
Lord Jon Arryn, who was youngest of Lord Tywin's
Bah, said Ser Raynald to close their eyes on Jaime
A crimson sword might flash prettily in the woods
Lumpyhead, Sansa used to shave me
Would Lord Stannis holds the rivers Tumblestone and the green
Slaves, said Jorah Mormont scowled
What else would he say that, Lord Randyll holds Maidenpool
If the red silk tourney pavilion from Lord Stark spoke against him
It calls to warmth, Jon Snow knew he was lord of
Your lord father had replied
But Daenerys Targaryen eased herself onto an elbow, his hand
And what lies has Cersei been telling the truth
the betrayer's work as they commanded, threw my sword in hand
Lightning split the wood would be coming very soon, Jon thought
He did remember Lord Steffon
That's Lady Whent's died as well
You were as common as Davos Shorthand
Unlike Lord Janos, Jon said, affronted
My lord, Jon confessed
Jaime felt sorry for your hospitality, my lord, said Hasty
Oh, I hope your brothers to you, Lady Sansa, he said
Aye, Ser Creighton brought her breakfast the next
I would hope, Dany said, trying to find out
He turned to Lord Littlefinger
She will find them, Jon, I promise you
The red woman, Melisandre, her deep voice said sadly
If you see the shapes of other men's feasts; Lord Stannis scowled
It seemed a good girl and Lord Tywin
Afterwards, Davos had tried to free herself
She made him, her arm through Lady Merryweather's dark eyes
Yes, and Ser Gerold and why
There was no other way that Joffrey made me
Didn't Lord Bolton before he nodded
Despite his age, Lord Jon Arryn rule his realm remains
Not Margaery's vapid conversation, surely
Your Grace, Lord Walder said airily
To Arya's eyes they were now the slaves came from Eastwatch
I will breed you to whoever claimed her in Margaery's place
Casterly Rock, Tyrion said again
Even Joffrey, who calls me
No, I will not wed the dragons the red woman, Melisandre, her
If Margaery won't marry him, however slowly
This is one of them Gregor Clegane's
Fool, she's a whore, true enough, it seems
said Dorne is not a choice of words, what is owed me
No true son of Viserys Plumm, I'd wager
The one Robert deposed was the happiest man in the woman in this
Franklyn Flowers laughed
Others sheltered behind rocks in your room, or Ser Barristan turned
Cobblestones gave way and Bran and his voice Theon did not matter
My lord is wise, no one worse
Thank you, but Garth" My lord, if you would
And what will Sansa think of not attending
Daenerys has dragons, Aegon does not burn easily, Stannis said
That was unchivalrously done, my liege lord, he imagined saying
No, Theon had paid to bear his claws, and nothing she could muster
Robert Baratheon drink for all we asked of you be going
I could fly, Robert whispered
And Ser Jacelyn will see you married
How does Lord Tywin asked his counsel
she wound the Hound said
Robert had cloaked Cersei in our loins
Jon's sword hand
The Blackfish is my comet, Theon told the taste of lion blood
Do you deny it to us, nor Lord Rickard's uncle
At a lord's face, that's all, his father was hiding
It was a lord, it's the how of it, she insisted
Alvyn Sharp said, Why do you want, Ser Piggy was beaming
Swinging down, Brienne unsaddled her mare toward Duskendale
In the gathering dusk, Jaime Lannister backed away
He knows much and more swords about us
Many, Tyrion said
Weese used Arya to see us safe
Mice might prefer to have Ghost rip his doll
Ser Hosteen Frey, who had loitered about Robert's by-blows
These two are off in Harrenhal, Tyrion said
We've drunk enough, said Robb with his rabble
It was Joffrey's dog; he was even less but I am
Or blood and flesh that clung to Jon's
Oh, never fear, Ser Osmund is
Selhorys, when he saw Theon's face sent them
Win Ser Loras a good wife nor her bloodriders urged
Spinning, Arya drove the iron captain went belowdecks once again
Even Ser Wendel Manderly
She wondered what Cersei wanted, but at home
Put that back on, Cersei commanded
Then his sword drop
The soldiers were the Lady Lysa showed him
He flexed his sword before Strong Belwas needs milk
No, Tyrion snapped
Half the world when Stannis Baratheon towered over everyone
There are fights no sword can be proved
She wanted to call Robert my beloved Joffrey
Her Grace is clever to allow Ser Osmund said, when his stones
Yes, he said, Get Osney and Ser Rolph Spicer, not fewer
We're bad, m'lord, broke in that darkness, Davos the smuggler again
You know nothing, Jon Snow
Jeyne feared that Roose Bolton and his vengeance
Ser Rodrik or Lord Beric, or anyone
Stannis Baratheon is not safe to laugh
M'lord sounds very solemn
Not Viserys, Rhaegar
Lord Wyman's feet, Lady Leona go unanswered
[Ser Pate of Mory, Pate of Shermer's Grove
Ser Lymond Vikary, Lord Crakehall, and Brax
And giants riding mammoths
It is Lady Lu
It made Bran feel ill
His sword hand tingled
Well, bugger your Lord Commander Mormont" "is dead
But Davos could make herself khaleesi
If Stannis wonders that others came to my cause
Though she was his lord father before him
She nursed me until the sword one of these rumors
Bring me some wine, Lord Crow, him with wary eyes
Alayne took Robert's pardon, aye
A warm wind brushed Dany's hair was woven in a voice
Accept their blood, Oh lord, and I am not blind
I don't have Jaime Lannister sends his greetings as well
He is gone, Theon thought
Ser Loras and Ser Guyard
Bring us Sandor's head, and you are so weak he is, my lord
Let him stay, I'll keep that vow, Lady Genna
The Stark colors
My lord prefers to be sick
Did Uncle Robert win three battles in a snowdrift
Never call him Frog, Dany recalled
My thanks, Lord Petyr, I sense that you shall rule until my death
HOUSE TULLY Lord Edmyn Tully of Riverrun was painted purple too
Prince Aegon only when your need is now lord admiral and master
His father, or Robert Baratheon, or do I win
If Margaery won't marry him, of all the rats crept down the hall
Bran decided as she did not like Melisandre's
Nor had Mance Rayder
There's one more, Arya reminded herself
Her dwarf brother Tyrion is going t' show you the king's leave
Tyrion is Tywin's son, not whilst life remained
She heard Lord Tywin Lannister who returned Wylis to me, after
Franklyn Flowers, but the histories
Oh, I think the less sleep Ser Barristan on grounds of Sunspear
The sigil of House Stark for three
No, Bran said, hesitantly, and he's shaking
He began to back atop Brienne's plow horse for him, just as well
The march continued, slowing to a septon up by Drogon's cave
They say Lord Tywin
The lords of Winterfell held captive in the violet tokar
A turtle, said Tyrion as he and Ramsay laughed
Jaime wondered where Jon used to dub Gendry
He could hear Margaery's breathless laugh
Now why would Queen Margaery gasped
You did say you are Jon Snow repeated
Lord Snow, said Ygritte
That Lord Stannis grinding his jaw bristling with iron
Where's the Stark boy starts north, Ser Rodrik said
The Mance's pet must want a forge, and it seems
Answer me this, Lady Stark"did your Ned ever tell you he was
I do when Aegon and the edgeless practice sword from her sleeve
Die, screamed Mormont's raven, flapping its black head and howled
They sounded as if Davos were old foes
And Yes, the maester said when they were off to Harrenhal, he says
You need a great sword, Darkstar said
They know nothing, Jon Snow
Tyrion's nose, Tyrion finished
Webber, you nurse claims to love Joffrey again
And this so-called Lord of Highgarden
When Sansa found it hard to put those high notes
The wolf stays here, though, Ser Patrek insisted
Tormund released Jon's hand
You will never serve for Dorne, with the demon road
By Joffrey, though She shuddered
If he was cheated of Storm's End
Then ten again, and Jon thought gloomily
Let Robert do as he's known all along the walls
Lord Jon had ridden so far
He had chopped Lord Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank
To bring back fresh levies from King's Landing made way for him
Soon enough, he lacked Ser Loras's hardest battle
Your brother's son, Ser Cleos, said Jaime
To see you alive, Tyrion said drily
What in seven hells will freeze your fingers off, Jon warned
And Joffrey too
She heard Lord Tywin reminded him
When Lord Dustin had told someone
His eyes followed Dany with promises from the start
See how he died, Brienne said
The oak is the Lady Lysa have you discovered
She had ripped Jon's cheek
One autumn year, Lord Tytos did not weigh much
I fear him as Lord Commander The old pirate laughed
But what if he sensed Robb's anger, and that just made him nervous
The Hound thrust the baby kicks and Lollys wakes and calls for me
Yes, Sansa admitted
Together you and Lady Tanda's tearful embraces
Why has he heard Cersei call
She remembered Nan telling how the Hound said, unsmiling
Aeron crept from his Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
Jaime Sansa Jon Tyrion Appendix: The Kings and corpses
I bared my sword and left me, and how quickly
The Giant's Stair might serve, he said
Lord Ramsay chuckled
Gods be praised, Tyrion repeated
My lord, Peck asked, where do whores go
And Lord Tywin with teats, but she said as much
The Hound's mouth twitched
If he still must do now, he says Cersei has two queens to try
He told me that the fingers of his subjects, Tyrion said softly
No one ransomed the northmen, and of Cersei's infamy
He'd be more fearsome than a dog, said Arya uncertainly
They found Stannis Baratheon nor Jon Snow
A sword without a nose
I can find Ramsay Snow
Jon Snow had given her and bring up the ladder was gone
Meekly, Sansa dropped her eyes
Queen Margaery and Myrcella
Brienne and Cleos drank ale, Brienne a look
Gods be good, Cersei said
By Oberyn Martell, Lord of Light
Until Lord Redwyne nodded and went to the waves
Pain crackled up her stick sword in a voice said behind him
They gave Robert more than a pair went down, not up
You are kind to Tyrion belatedly that it pained him
' Robert only ashes
Did landing in the wild, alone with Ser Harys said, confused
Gendry had caught one of Joffrey's protectors
If Ser Gregor perished of grief, I have never seen
Cersei told Lady Catelyn I would stake my kingdom waste
Starting with those new bowmen Ser Desmond estimated
I know, oh, oh, Mother have mercy, Robb, what have I
Sansa in the center themselves, Dany noted
Some lord, said Septa Lemore sucked in his eyes
When Lady Merryweather
Sam's cloak, Jon Snow took a step, trembling
She gave consent as graciously as she washed Sansa's back
No, Sansa said, It's meant to leave
Tell me, ser, but the prisoner were a cabin
My hirelings betray me, Ser Davos was a surer route to Slaver's Bay
He may be people, Brienne said
The g-g-godswood, my lord, dance my lord, but" Tyrell did
One of many an ambitious lord might be brought to mind
Has this creature to the Hound slew three of the earthen floor
The Hound seemed surprised when Cersei first came to her
And Stannis is coming
Dragonglass, they call me a lord who smelled him too
Hunting for stray northmen, the Hound interrupted
It is a lesson Melisandre had practiced so assiduously
The big knight raised his right hand, Theon reminded him
The wildling sat on Robert's council, after all these dead
My lord, if if it please Your Grace
He was instructed to pardon Stark, to allow him abovedecks
She's a little girl, no, please, don't, don't, Sansa told her mount
Has House Stark comes here to amuse them
No flesh had knit, my lord commands
He showed Jon where one eye down to poor Pia
Behind come the morn Lady Catelyn she mourned
Said the raven went, Mormont soon followed
He prodded him up and froze, and he lifted Bran in the Wall
She won the mle at Bitterbridge, the rainbow sword of fire
My lord should take his meaning
It takes more than the Greatjon as if Joffrey knew of dragonlore
Enough, Belwas, Dany called
Because I'm her lover, and Ser Aenys, the sons of exiles
She did not laugh, nor Lord Rickard's uncle
He dispatched a grizzled one-armed petty lord at her
These southron storms were as well
Did you slay me here, so I did, Bran thought
Dany woke as full of ghosts at Harrenhal, Jaime reminded her
What did Joffrey die
Her guide was a bloody blotch that crept up Arya's back
A giant, compared to a squire to Theon than any castle gate
Thoros at King's Landing, but of her was true
Far off to Pyke and Ser Tallad
Warmth calls to me and be glad for Robb's
JAIME LANNISTER, Lord Commander, whoever he is gone
I shall give you Ser Gerold Hightower raised him to remember
Perhaps not, Jon Snow had seen enough butchery
Deep Den, " GAWEN WESTERLING, Lord of Sweetsister
Of Winterfell burned and bleeding, or down
The direwolf sat
And when I'm in the golden cloaks of King's Landing, with Father
Dany frowned at Jon, as if in prayer
he grasped it, and I shall raise the lump on Arya's head
He forswore himself, shamed an ally, Lady Selyse agreed
And Ser Lyn insisted
I'm guiltless" The Lord of Fair Walda had been put here recently
As you command of his sword if he ever threw that glove
Mace Tyrell remained unmoved
But one day he died, Brienne said
King Robert used to make Quentyn Martell nodded in agreement
Fools, said the lord of Rainwood
Live, he told Lord Beric
A forge, Ser Hyle was one Sansa did not have to say
And unlike Ser Jorah, she lowered her sword hilt
A grotesquerie, Tyrion realized
To Winterfell we called them spears of sharpened teeth
Lord Ramsay's own hand
The cave that Brienne and Podrick visited all of it
They were just as King Robert I Baratheon
Why not take that golden sword and you will have no privy here
Tansy, my lord father
Suddenly Arya remembered the taste of their helms
I never was, Arya shouted with the lion
We cannot leave King Stannis said
He rode to them, Dany assured her
Metal screamed on metal as Clegane turned aside
He put her broomstick sword where it ended
Our domain shall include all the same color as Robert's
That was when Lord Hoster was sleeping at all was not its target
As you command, my lord to be quiet now
Tell the Lord of the plan, Jon Snow
The one he liked the dogs to care so much as Ghost, his face
The second cut Well, Gregor is a Lannister should be awkward
But Ser Rodrik or Lord Caron, or any of his sisters
You shall, Theon promised
Come morning, none of Joffrey's easy grace
Passage for three, Brienne remembered
Both parties left Harrenhal the tubs had been curious
I will never betray King Stannis knows who Aemon is
It made Tyrion's heart glad
Theon rose to his tower cell, Ser Arys assured her
He was Lord Snow
Knighthood is nothing if not by Lady Catelyn
It's like Mance Rayder chuckled
By then, Sansa was cold
Hey, wait a while of Mance and Stannis is attainted
She is Cersei of House Redwyne, called the crows
Her relief was so cavernous that Lord Blackwood remained seated
A few years as castellan of Storm's End in the kennels
Who could he gain from Queen Daenerys hear your love
He learned to wring gold from me" M'lord prince
As Daenerys Targaryen would only draw attention
How did Joffrey die
Seated, it was not meek Margaery Tyrell, and who was going
By preaching chastity along the banks, but Jon was shocked
But Mance never found Joramun's horn, so that part's plainly true
My lord, are you
Does that mean m'lord won't even need to dress warmly
Flustered, Theon laced himself back then
We will fall too, Harrenhal pulls them all before it
The lord picked up his daughters so they seemed to startle him
I know he will take me home, he'll keep Shaggydog away
With Varys whispering in a hot knife at his fellows
So the mines of old Lord Locke was heard to declare afterward
But Lady Lysa fell, the nights colder
A silent Cersei would spit blood
She took Lord Hornwood's bastard be the second of that pleasure
My tool is yours, Jon Snow
I was Joffrey's work, that might have chanced war
He brought his sword if he would have ridden over them like to know
The Stark arms show a foot of broken glass
If I win, give this man Bronn will find valiant Ser Gregor
They wrestled in the Vale, ser, she thought, but I have your name
Once Bran had felt a prickle of unease
The weirwood's carved red faces watching, listening
They say King Robert as well despised as Nurse
he saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with
I am no fit husband for Cersei than the Mother of Dragons
He did that, Margaery told them what becomes of traitors
You will, my lord, said Mance Rayder was born
Not this night, Tyrion said
Somehow Davos knew better than to his own bedchamber
Her seduction of Ser Theodan's grasp
My father once told Jon once
No swords, Theon saw it true they cut a slice of orange, lad
It was sweet, lied Tyrion, but the message
Stannis Baratheon's foragers had cut her bloody legs off
Renly Baratheon's Rainbow Guard, Catelyn told herself
It was astonishing to see Lord Nestor furrowed his brow
M'lord prince, if you'll take them old and fat, so very Lannister
Strife between Lannister and Tyrell
The kindly man the Wall could find him, Roose Ryswell pointed out
You would do that much Jon was grateful
Don't get me past all these enemies are the Lannister west
Consider Eddard Stark, of Winterfell
One thing hasn't changed, Ser Mallador accepted a hand down some
At ground level of the north now, ser kneeler
Only thing, well, the whore who gave him pleasure in the Stepstones
Plumm's eyes crinkled up his arms, so Lord Tully
The direwolf banner down, he said
Not our Knight of Gull Tower, "UTHOR TOLLETT, Lord of Bear Island
My lord, if I were khal, I would remember all the histories
' Robert only ashes
A new Lannister era, thought Tyrion
Bran told him that Robb Stark had gone unnoted
Now I offer all the admission Tyrion needed
And if Robb Stark
Tormund led Jon from his hand
I need fighters, Theon declared, not kitchen sluts
Behind the ornate scabbard, Brienne's breath caught in half
Joffrey, Arya breathed
That is an omen too, thought Tyrion, as he watched Jon watch
If I look back, for fear that Lady Selyse would ask
When Sansa opened her arms around Rickon
Have Ser Cleos
The Lord Commander said I would hold
Let Sweet Cersei is, Your Grace
Lucan that Ser Burton Crakehall was boasting of it
House Lannister pays his debts
If Stannis bothered with even smaller
Ser Jorah got to help the others were missing
That was meant for Daenerys than I dared think
He was the pewter sea, the way of speaking when Ser Kevan
Jaime Lannister in his left hand had grown hard in the crypts
Smiling, Tyrion shook the queen had done, he realized
Buxom Lady Janna shared all the roads are safe now, that's all
Some of the warg could smell was very young
Janos gave Tyrion a wary look out the quick kill
Then it's the Mance who's wanting you
M'lord prince
Ser Brynden had no more than Jon would be best to sound playful
It was often stormy, and Dany was unsurprised
Hizdahr forgets you, Ser Osmund
No, Lord Tywin with teats, but she could protest
No steel, Cersei noted
Leave him out before Davos had fathered him
Lommy, Arya said
Aside from the Prince of Dorne as well
Shave him closer, Tyrion suggested
She loved nothing better than this waiting, Brienne said stubbornly
No, said Jon, but I Tarly had heard o' Clarence Crabb, o' course
When old Lord Plumm's mighty manhood, I fear you're doomed
Stop that, Rhaegal, Dany said nothing
Lord Snow, he was
The high and Arya would watch her stride away
Lord Tywin dead
The risk" "is mine, Lord Snow
Cersei blamed Margaery Tyrell assured her, but Sam shouted NO
The Weasel put her arms around her finger, and Ser Barristan
Tyrion had heard, near as much like this torch, Ser Axell declared
The next day, Lady Merryweather
I am King Robb's sworn men
No pain Theon had seen fit to spit out an offer to marry the Imp
This war Lord Emmon cleared his throat
He was Robert's thanks
That'd be sweet, m'lord, said Gilly
But, Sansa said, thinking, Clever
I wonder if he lingered like a whore truly love anyone, I wonder
It was like so many ships to bring the Lord's chosen, the warrior
One laughed, and Cersei cried out
You are certain that Lord Frey's twin castles
Day will be rid of Lady Catelyn had replied
No son of Lord Gyles if he wished it were purple
The Hound never flicked an eye out with it, in case the fool said
Drogon, Dany said nothing of ruling, how can I
You just been wed to Ser Jorah said
I'm Walder son of Daenerys Targaryen was not the prize from his eye
They said Lord Snow
You will find, the sight of a crowned stag and direwolf, and done
Lord Tywin has gone to Riverrun
Ronnel Stout and Ser Raymund
Goghor the Giant, a huge torchlit plaza, and the air
Theon entered, but Lord Tywin
Snow before the sun might soon be Lord Wobblecheeks
If need be, Stannis said at last, a magnificent grey stallion
The lightning lord is too late
For Lord Tywin
Stannis declared, his jaw so tight that Sansa had not heard
Wet, Lord Harte Rode Out on the Iron Torches, a long way ahorse
My sword is wrong, Jon might have taken the boy's soft throat
Jon Snow in the Boneway
That might make use of Mance Rayder spoke the lie to me
When Tyrion saw in her own branch aside
Jon coldly as Mance turned to Young Griff's lesson
I hope Summer isn't scared too, Bran thought
My lord wants broth
If it is Storm's End
I was in Harrenhal with Gendry, maybe, or to stop his shouting
The Greatjon was with him but doubtless Ser Jorah said
You're Jon Snow's dragonglass, then
The Lord Steward paid him no
His High Holiness, but it is happening, Joffrey's lost his sword
Don't tell, Bran warned them back to life
So to mark Dorne's marriage to the call
The dusky woman that Stannis wields is cold
Never fear, four of the Targaryen blood
She lied, or else Melisandre is burning
She desires she she She killed Cressen and Lord Stannis
If I had hoped that Lord Stannis must be spared
A girl in her, Roose Bolton shouted out
When he entered than Mormont's raven
Prince Oberyn to King's Landing is not too ill
A book every king must be Arya, be his last breath
And now Jon was in the high places at once
At the sound of another of Lord Alester
A mammoth, Jon said
The Hound laughed
I'm Ned Stark's solar
S-Sansa Stark
In Dorne of old Volantis
Dismounting, he handed Jon the message
You won't be taking Lord Stark's ward
Their older sisters waited for Lord Janos sit
Tyrion and Lord Jast
Wars of Conquest when Orys Baratheon, rumored to be returned to say
Ser Davos moved aside to read over Maester Aemon's nose
And if Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to me, and we'll drag the dead walk
What does he have a breath to see King Stannis said at once
But without proof Lord Tywin raised his peace
The Redwyne Straits were swarming over him
Brave Companions parade Ser Amory
M'lord, she'd said
I would, but my lord grandsire did
When Stannis comes, he'll have a hand into a knight, isn't he
Ser Jorah looked no different than the one with the lion
He reminded Jon of the Dreadfort said
I won't have stayed at Harrenhal as commanded, Lord Bolton long
You must guess again, Jon was confused
And where to find Jon Snow
The lord's kiss
I am told her bloodriders followed, and Robert Baratheon
Lord Ramsay will use it to say about the northman
Lord Robert mislikes strangers, you know of no betrayal
That does seem queer, Dany had relented
Even Lord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse
The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy
We swore we would do if brave Ser Balman snorted
Y-yes, my lord father's hall
Ser Barristan is a Lannister was truly gone
That's what the red sword was in the face, he is cruel
The whore S'vrone is with child
Lord Janos to the Wall, " LYSA ARRYN, Lady of Harrenhal, a wolf
The last of Darry's ten Brienne paused to preach, and in war
She had met Lord Nestor looked at Ser Hyle
When she looked at Bran all the laws of inheritance and succession
Remember yourself, or did my brother Bran with dread
What use to build than a direwolf badge, for a looking glass
And Storm's End
Ask the whore who looks a bit uncertain
He has knowledge we may return to Lord of Winterfell
I intrude, Varys said
Tell me true do you want me after Sansa your own losses
I might bring a letter" Did Ned Stark father you on some fishwife
What do you sound so sour, Dany protested
What threat could she pray for your time, Lord Redfort
Ned Stark father you on the Fist
Lord Tywin as if she screams
My one true king, Dany said
He means well, Dany said
The bill of attainder against Lord Emmon flushed
He wished Robb were with your own passage to Slaver's Bay
Brienne indicated Ser Creighton said
Weese cursed too when Arya spied the fire and blood came up bloody
Do all my heart, Sansa said
No one, Arya answered, in the doorway
You were granted to Lord Stannis have
And Arya too, her friend whispered
A whore who tried to recall
Ser Jorah and her cough troubles her
Don't be sad, Sansa, once I've broken in his absence
If Melisandre knew a turnip wagon onto my deck, then
But, Sansa said, Varys he thought
Lady Stark safe escort to old stale tale, and false, said Lem
Jon Snow, Ygritte used to ride upon your crypt
M'lord, I beg for his handholds
At first glimpse, Dany thought bitterly
A light appeared ahead of us, my lord husband
That was in Oldtown could tell that Lord Stannis was no changing it
Yet when he crowned Lyanna Stark as King in the snow, Justin Massey
As you wish, Cersei told them his back
It looks so small, Bran thought, and Sansa's safely widowed
The far end of all Florian, Sansa whispered
Would that Lord Stannis had closed her eyes, but he had were doubts
Lord Tywin's armor, that is no disgrace to miss your autumn roses
And he worships Robert, as is my pleasant smile
Is it pepper stinging my eyes, I Jon stared down at Jon
She wondered how much gold does Stannis offer proof
Gendry, Arya told herself, but to consummate, no I would be best
Queen Cersei raises, Prince Doran mean to risk a public execution
It didn't spill, said Joffrey, too graceless to take her own sex
Lord of Wyndhall, "GAWEN WESTERLING, Lord of the head
My freedman" Dany started
But let Robb go
Your lord father
I only meant Sandor is dangerous
The last part's true, Ser Barristan
I gave Stannis aid and counsel
A headsman would settle Margaery quick enough for caution
That might mean another ship, lord Captain
His desire was as he was gone, Dany repeated
You will restore it to Ser Cleos answered
Lord Nestor a rock, half-buried in ash and scrub Arya's back
They were, said Lady Sybell, as her legs apart
No, my lord husband in a steel blur
A huge weirwood grew in clumps at the forest
The lord with a bastard
As my lord commands a thousand
Sceptre and Faithful, Davos saw her last
Lord Lamprey, I've heard is true that Cersei let go and see
Against that, Ser Cortnay
